RELEASE_2_11
* bugfix: the status() function would fail if there were no players present.
* added capability to run the script directly, and either it will execute its
  test suite, or it will run the given rcon command.
* added more keys to the info dictionary (returned by the status function):
  fps,cpu_usage,in,out,ip,port,uptime
* added even more keys to the info dictionary (returned by the status functions):
  secure,passworded,exe_version,server_os,server_type,current_botcount,max_players,
  current_playercount,app_id,game_description,game_directory,current_map,server_name,
  protocol_version,hl_version
* added a bunch of docstrings
RELEASE_2_10
* MODIFICATION: the "status" function, rather than returning a list of
  dictionaries, now returns two dictionaries.  The first dictionary (info) is a dictionary
  containing 'version', 'map','players',and 'slots' that can be gleaned from the "rcon
  status" command (more to come).  The second dictionary is a dictionary of player
  dictionaries, with the keys being the user id's.  The contents of each individual player
  dictionary is the
  same as before.
* bugfix: fixed 'IndexError' in the status function
* added the following functions: ban, unban, restart, version, currentmap, nplayers
* added the cvar patch (function to return the value of a console variable)
* added simple unit testing of the module at the bottom

RELEASE_2_02
* Fixed details() bug which raised an exception when calculating 'app_id'

RELEASE_2_01
* Fixed players() bug which occured when players() was queried while a player was connecting
* Fixed bug in status() where method didn't iterate past the first player
* Fixed details() query to return 'app_id' instead of 'unknown1' and 'unknown2'

RELEASE_2_00
* Queries updated to use new request formats, and challenge numbers. 
* SRCDS._any_response(QUERY) now supports multi-packet responses. 
* SRCDS.__init__() now supports hostnames as well as ip. 
* SRCDS.__init__() also supports timeout=secs argument, to specify upd/tcp socket timeouts. 
* SRCDS now fully supports HL1 servers (with automatic discovery of hl 
version), with HLDS subclassed from SRCDS for backwards compatibility 
HLDS. 
* No longer attempts tcp connection unless required for HL2 RCON 
* RCON support almost completely rewritten: 
* More accurate RCON password checking for Source 
* Fixed multi-packet TCP recv bug from 1.01 
* HL1 RCON support added (with automatic discovery of hl version) 
* SRCDS.status() method rewritten without StringIO module 
* Better Exception raising
